Hello,

I have uploaded all my sources here :
http://hydroz.net/ftp/flightgear_sources/

Share, share, share, under GPL of course ;-)

I don't have time anymore for flight imulation but love the idea that my
model still flew in other skies ;-)
We keep in touch, keep me informed of the works ;-)

Cheers
